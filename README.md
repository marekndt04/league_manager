# Info and Goals

    As a hockey enthusiast and also amateur player I was always very frustrated that any events like amateur leagues or cups doesn't have their own website where You can check statistics or standings. In city where a I live we have at least two leagues at this level of competition. Results are always publicated with delay on facebook or other websites in form of short summary.

    This short history brings the introduction where I decided to create simple league manager administrated by captains of teams from my city.

## Main assumptions
    At this point of my developer's experience I feel comfortable with Wagtail(Django) framework so I've decided to use it to create this app. I'm going to create website with statically served htmls which will be quite fun, since I'm mostly involved into creating REST APIs serving JSON DATA :smile:. As a part of self-development I want to cover topics like :

    * AWS deployment
    * Azure deployment
    * K8S (lets call it polishing skills, since I'm not totally unfamiliar with that)
    * Helm charts
    * Test-Driven-Development
    * Replication and synchronization of PostgreSQL database to DynamoDB or Elasticsearch
